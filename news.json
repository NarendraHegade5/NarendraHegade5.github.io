    "description": "Excited to announce our new experimental work, in collaboration with IonQ, on higher-order binary optimization using BF-DCQO. In particular, we tackle protein folding with up to 12 amino acids, one of the largest implementations to date on a quantum computer, max-4-SAT at the computational phase transition with up to 36 qubits, and a fully connected spin-glass problem using 36 qubits. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07866\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arXiv:2506.07866</a>",

    "description": "Comparison of a random binary sequence versus the optimal low-autocorrelation sequence of length 30. In the animation, you can see that the optimal sequence exhibits a single dominant peak at zero lag, with all other side-lobes suppressedâ€”unlike the random sequence, whose autocorrelation side-lobes fluctuate widely.",
